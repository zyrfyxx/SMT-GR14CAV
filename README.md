# File Structure

There are four folders:

**SMT_GR(1)_DataSet**  

- `Data1`-`Data10` are example specifications described based on constraint solving methods.  `Example` is an example of execution.
- `Date_Core_1` to `Date_Core_59` is the data set for **RQ2**. 

**SpectraData**  
This folder contains the specifications based on Boolean encoding method for `Data1`-`Data10` in `SMT_GR(1)_DataSet`.

**Experiment**

The data set for **RQ1**. 

**SMGR1**  
This is a Java project for syntax parsing. The main function is located in `parserMain`. It takes `InputSpec.txt` from `Data1-Data10` in the `SMT_GR(1)_DataSet` folder as input, generating the intermediate file `AbstractSpec.txt` and a file that records various information from the initial specifications.

**PythonProject**  
This is a Python project that includes three parts:

- **Calculate unsatisfiable cores:** The main function is located in `Constraints.py`, which takes the intermediate file `AbstractSpec.txt` generated by the **SMGR1** project and the file recording various information from the initial specifications as input. It computes the initial conditions and all the unreachable cores, appending them to the new specifications, with the final specifications located in `FinalSpec.txt`.
- **Example of execution**: The main function is located in `AutoParse.py`, which parses the synthesized automaton using `Example` as a running example. The input automaton file is `automaton.txt`, produced from the final specifications generated by `Constraints.py`. It also reads the file recording various information from the initial specifications, converting to boolean variables based on the environment input set in the function `getEnvValue()` and the current state set in `getCurrentValue()`, according to the results parsed from `automaton.txt`.
- **Run RQ2:** The main function is located in `CoreTimeTest.py`, with the input being `Date_Core_1` to `Date_Core_59` from `SMD_GR (1) _SataSet`.

## Using Spectra Tool for Synthesis

We synthesize the final specifications obtained by our method with the specifications described by **Spectra** for comparison experiments using the Spectra tool. The configuration scheme for the Spectra environment can be referenced on the website [SYNTECH - Spectra (tau.ac.il)](http://smlab.cs.tau.ac.il/syntech/spectra/), and we also list it below:

- Download and install [Eclipse for Java and DSL Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2023-06/r/eclipse-ide-java-and-dsl-developers) (Windows 64Bit).
- Use "Eclipse/Help/Install new software..." to install Spectra Tools from the site: `http://smlab.cs.tau.ac.il/syntech/spectra/tools/update/`.

After creating a Spectra project in Eclipse, copy the specifications into the `.spectra` file, then right-click and run `Spectra/Synthesize xx Controller` to obtain the strategy automaton.

## How to Run

```bash
docker build -t smt:latest .
docker run -it --rm smt:latest
